# Janitorial
Another CSS theme to clean up a bunch of ugly stuff I don't like on Discord. Inspired by [Dubyas's CSS](https://github.com/DubyaDude/DubyasCleanupOfDiscord/blob/main/DubyasCleanupOfDiscord.css) and based on [cheesits456's thread](https://gist.github.com/cheesits456/41d659f932b5a574b5dfb9b391a4506e) on cleaning up some chat buttons.  
Thanks all who made me aware of some of these tweaks. I tried to credit you best I could!

# Installation
## Vencord -- Local method
Just download `janitor.theme.css` and put it in `%appdata%/vesktop/themes`

## Vencord - Online method
Copy `[https://github.com/HarvestSorts/janitorial/raw/refs/heads/main/janitorial.theme.css` and paste it in your online themes section.

## Any other Discord mod
Idk put it in your themes folder or copy the css into your css editor
